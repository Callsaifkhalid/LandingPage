            for our services, we will share only as much information as is
            necessary for the provision of those services. These third parties
            are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information
            for any other purpose. We may disclose a consumer’s personally
            identifiable information in order to effect or carry out any
            transaction that you have requested of us or as necessary to
            complete our contractual obligations with you. We may share your

            Clear Credit may sell, license or transfer your information to third
            parties for the purposes of sending you offers of goods or services

          <h2>CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h2>
          <span>
            We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your
            personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when
            we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a
            product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing
            material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order
            form. If you no longer wish to receive emails from us and/or
            promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by
            following the instructions included in each newsletter or
            communication or by emailing us at 
            <a href="mailto:Service@clearcredit.ai">Service@clearcredit.ai</a> .
            Please provide us with detailed email on communications you would
            like to opt out of. If your information has been shared with a third
            party has indicated above to provide you with promotional
            communications, your opt-out will not apply to those third parties.
            If you do not wish to be contacted by the third party after prior
            interaction, you must make a specific request to that provider, NOT
            Clear Credit. We may share information with third parties as
            indicated above. If you do not wish to have your personal
            information shared, sold or disclosed to a third party that is not
            our agent/service provider, please contact to actively opt-out of
            having your personal information shared. To do so, you can call or
            email Clear Credit to opt out of sharing at:{" "}

          <h2>SECURING THE TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION</h2>
          <span>
            The security of your personal information is extremely important to
            us. We employ generally accepted industry standards to protect the
            personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
            once we receive it. Our site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
            security technology to encrypt information you provide to us through
            the site when entering sensitive information (such as credit card
            number and/or social security number) on our registration or order
            forms. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels
            over the Internet. SSL is an industry-standard protocol for
            encryption over the internet. After information reaches Clear
            Credit, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind
            firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside
            of Clear Credit. You can help to maintain the security of your
            online transactions by not sharing your personal information or
            password with any. Remember, no method of transmission over the
            Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. (Example:
            any information you provide us by email is not encrypted) Therefore,
            while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
            personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
            you have any questions about the security on our Web site, please
            feel free to e-mail us.
          </span>
          <h2>LOG FILES</h2>
          <span>
            As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information
            automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
            internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
            provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
            stamp, and click stream data. We use this information, which does
            not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the
            site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather
            demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not
            link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable
            information.
          </span>
          <h2>COOKIES</h2>
          <span>
            A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer
            for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not
            link the information we store in cookies to any personally
            identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use
            session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you
            to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close
            your browser. We can, at your option, set a persistent cookie to
            store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.
            Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
            of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject
            cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
            areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.
            Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our
            site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This
            privacy statement covers the use of our cookies only and does not
            cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

          <h2>CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS/WEB BUGS)</h2>
          <span>
            We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also called Web
            Beacons or Web Bugs, that help us better manage content on our site
            by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
            graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
            and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast
            to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear
            gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of
            the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the
            information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally
            identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails
            to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This
            allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and
            the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to
            opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice/Opt-out.”
          </span>
          <h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
          <span>
            This Web site may contain links to other sites such as our
            affiliates as well as third parties which are not owned or
            controlled by us. Please be aware that this privacy policy only
            addresses Clear Credit’s use and disclosure of your information
            collected on this site. While we try to link only to sites that
            share our standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible
            for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to
            be aware when you leave our site and to read the applicable privacy
            policies and terms of conditions of each and every Web site that
            collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement
            applies only to information collected by this Web site.
          </span>
          <h2>CO-BRANDED SITES</h2>
          <span>
            We may be co-branded with{" "}
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>“partners and affiliates”</span>
            . These business to business relationships are helpful to us and to

            sharing of your information with such partners and affiliates.
            Please note the sites linked to our site are governed by their own

          <h2>UPDATES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
          <span>
            We strive to keep all personal information accurate and complete.
            You can access or change your personal information at any time;
            provided, however, that we may reject requests that are unreasonably
            repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, risk the
            privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical. We may also
            refuse a request to delete information if maintaining the
            information is required by law or is part of a fraud investigation,
            or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
          </span>
          <h2>CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>
          <span>
            If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we may
            retain such information in your customer file. Information you give
            us over the telephone may be noted for your file. We may also keep
            copies of any correspondence sent to you. We retain these records in
            order to provide the products and services you have requested and to
            measure and improve our customer service. We may, over time, delete
            these records as permitted by law. Phone calls may be recorded or
