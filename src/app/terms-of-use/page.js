            no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
            whether as a result of new information, future events and

          <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
          <span>
            IN NO EVENT SHALL CLEAR CREDIT AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AND
            AFFILIATES AND ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
            PROPRIETORS, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, SERVANTS,
            ATTORNEYS, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INDIRECT,
            PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER SIMILAR
            DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THIS
            SITE OR WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THIS SITE, OR FOR ANY
            INFORMATION, SERVICES, PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND MATERIALS
            AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SITE, OR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS
            INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR OTHER DATA ON YOUR INFORMATION
            HANDLING SYSTEM, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF UTILIZATION OF THIS
            SITE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
            OTHERWISE, EVEN IF CLEAR CREDIT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
            OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
            OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF ANY PART OF THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON,
            THE REMAINDER OF THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT,
            AND THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CLEAR CREDIT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
            SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED ($100.00) DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE. IF
            ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
            PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS OF
            WARRANTIES AND DAMAGES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN IN
            EFFECT.

          <h2>INDEMNITY</h2>
          <span>
            You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Clear Credit and
            its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates and all of their
            employees, agents, directors, officers, proprietors, partners,
            representatives, shareholders, servants, attorneys, predecessors,
            successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims,
            proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs, and
            expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation
            expenses), relating to or arising from your use of the Site, any
            breach by you of this TOU, or the submission by you of any material
            via the Site. Clear Credit reserves the right, at its own expense,
            to take over the exclusive defense of any third party claim or
            action, and in such event, you shall provide Clear Credit with such
            cooperation as is reasonably requested by Clear Credit. You hereby
            release Clear Credit and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates
            and all of their employees, agents, directors, officers,
            proprietors, partners, representatives, shareholders, servants,
            attorneys, predecessors, successors, and assigns from claims,
            demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
            suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of
            or in any way connected with your use of the Site. The obligations
            imposed by this Indemnity provision survive termination of this TOU
            and the license granted to you to use the Site.

          <h2>GENERAL PROVISIONS.</h2>
          <span>
            This TOU, Clear Credit’s <span style={{fontWeight:'700'}}>Privacy Policy</span>, and any related or
            associated service or software license agreements, which are all
            hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein,
            represent the entire agreement between you and Clear Credit with
            respect to use of the Site, and it supersedes all prior or
            contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
            oral, or written between you and Clear Credit with respect to this
            Site. Please note that Clear Credit reserves the right to change the
            terms and conditions of this TOU under which this Site and its many
            offerings are extended to you by posting a revised TOU.  In
            addition, Clear Credit may add or delete any aspect of this Site.
            You are responsible for reviewing this TOU periodically for changes,
            and your continued use of this Site following any change will be
            conclusively deemed acceptance of any change to the terms and
            conditions of this TOU. Accordingly, please review the TOU on a
            periodic basis. This TOU has been made in, and will be construed and
            enforced, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware as
            applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the
            State of Delaware. Any cause of action related to use of this Site
            must be commenced within (1) year after the claim or cause of action
            arises or is otherwise reasonably known. The sole jurisdiction and
            venue for any litigation arising out of the Site or this TOU shall
            be an appropriate federal or state court located in Delaware, and
            the parties agree not to raise, and hereby affirmatively waive, any
            objections or defenses based upon venue or forum non conveniens,
            except that Clear Credit may seek temporary injunctive relief in any
            venue of its choosing. This Site is controlled and operated by Clear
            Credit from its offices within the United States. Clear Credit makes
            no representation that the Site is appropriate or available for use
            in other locations, and access to the Site from territories or
            nations where any aspect of the Site is illegal is prohibited. You
            access this Site on your own volition and are responsible for
            compliance with all applicable local laws. Failure to insist on
            strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU
            will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of
            performance. No waiver by Clear Credit of any right under this TOU
            will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision
            or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If
            any part of this TOU is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
            pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
            warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above,
            then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
            superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly
            matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of
            this TOU shall continue in effect.
